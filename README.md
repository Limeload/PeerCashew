## How it works?

Meet Jane, a small business owner who needs to borrow $5,000 to purchase new equipment for her bakery. She visits PeerCashew and creates an account as a borrower. She then fills out an application, providing information about her business, credit history, and the purpose of the loan.

PeerCashew uses LinkedIn's Professional Network API to verify Jane's employment information and Stripe's Payment API to process her loan application fee. PeerCashew also runs a credit check on Jane using TransUnion's Credit Check API.

Jane's loan application is approved and listed on the PeerCashew platform for investors to fund. Investors can see the details of the loan, including the purpose, interest rate, and repayment schedule. Investors can then choose to invest in Jane's loan by sending the funds using Stripe's Payment API.

Once the loan is fully funded, the funds are sent to Jane's bank account using Stripe's Payment API. PeerCashew then uses Google Maps' Location and Geocoding API to verify Jane's address and display the location of the loan on a map.

Jane then repays the loan using PeerCashew's Payment API, which automatically deducts the payments from her bank account on the scheduled dates. PeerCashew also sends reminder emails to Jane when her payment is due using SendGrid's Email API.

Overall, PeerCashew provides an easy and streamlined process for borrowers like Jane to obtain loans and for investors to fund those loans.
